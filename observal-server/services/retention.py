"""Per-organization data retention purge service.

Runs as a cron job every 6 hours. For each org with retention_enabled=True:
1. Time-based purge: DELETE rows older than data_retention_days
2. Score/insight purge: DELETE scores + insight reports older than score_retention_days
3. Count-based purge: If trace count exceeds max_trace_count, find cutoff and purge
